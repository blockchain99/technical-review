'''
 There isnt a built-in data structure in Python that looks like a linked list. 
Thankfully, it's easy to make classes that represent data structures in Python! 
 
Here's the code for an Element, which will be a single unit in a linked list:'''
class Element1(object):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
         
'''This code is very similar—we're just establishing that a LinkedList is something 
that has a head Element, which is the first element in the list. If we establish 
a new LinkedList without a head, it will default to None. '''
         
class LinkedList1(object):
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head
         
'''Great! Let's add a method to our LinkedList to make it a little more useful. 
This method will add a new Element to the end of our LinkedList.'''
        
    def append(self, new_element):
        current = self.head
        if self.head:
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_element
        else:
            self.head = new_element

"""The LinkedList code from before is provided below.
Add three functions to the LinkedList.
"get_position" returns the element at a certain position.
The "insert" function will add an element to a particular
spot in the list.
"delete" will delete the first element with that
particular value.
Then, use "Test Run" and "Submit" to run the test cases
at the bottom."""
